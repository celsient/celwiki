Taroko Gorge is situated in the North-East of Taiwan, in lands once occupied by the Truku aboriginal people. Today, it is the heart of the Republic of China’s Taroko National Park and the setting of Nick Montfort’s 2009 generative poem, ‘Taroko Gorge’.  

Written primarily in JavaScript, ‘Taroko Gorge’ tells a sensory passage through the park with lines and stanzas generated randomly within set parameters. Much like nature itself, the walk through its world is different every time, but contained within bounds of natural possibility. “Stone” may “frame the flow”, “basin”, “shape”, “vein”, “rippling”, “stone”, “cove”, or “rock” — as set by the below variable — but never the “forest”, contained within the above variable. Thus are the parameters of nature possible within the gorge, separating the bounties it truly provides from the flights of fancy one can fantasise.

The poem is composed of stanzas of variable lengths, followed by hazy meanders into non-grammatical thought — “shade the sinuous straight dim” — each time disrupted by an em-dash, one of the widest and most jarring standard Unicode characters, before being brought back into coherent thought. It is as if our guided view of the natural world, forced into uniformity, is drifting into a more primal and pre-linguistic relationship with nature before our neocortex reels us back in.

The poem takes us on a post-internet site-seeing holiday through lands occupied and occupied again, first by the arrival of Imperial Japan in the late 19th century, and then with the Kuomintang, fleeing from the mainland after the Chinese civil war. Montfort’s poem presents the majesty of nature in a form devoid of the intricate relationship humanity has with it, at once ceding priority to supreme nature and drawing attention to the lack of humanity. The poem uses no pronouns, so even as a reader walks these desolate lands, their personhood is taken from them.

“Taroko” is, after all, an imperial exonym for the Truku people who once lived in these lands, morphed and distorted by the phonemic inventory of Japanese into something recognisable but uncanny. The park too was established by the Japanese Empire after war with the Truku that resulted in grievous injury for the Japanese but, ultimately, a brighter day for the Rising Sun. After Japan’s victory in the lands, they displaced and isolated its people, moving them individually into Han Chinese neighbourhoods in an act of ethnic and cultural cleansing. They hoped to undermine their personhood and remove them as a threat. ‘Taroko Gorge’’s human absence echoes this sentiment, a land haunted and isolated in the name of empire and industry.

Ironic, then, that a poem about land colonised for resources is told through a medium only possible due to the technological and resource-based advancements of the imperial occupier. Japan’s dominance in the computing hardware market only came about because of their colonial ambitions, and the colonial ambitions of America in the post-war, bringing Japan deeper into its existence as a capitalistic juggernaut of global economy.

After the war and Imperial Japan’s severing, the Republic of China abolished Taroko’s distinction as a national park, only to recognise it two decades later. Much like the nature of the poem, they could try to kill the plant, but the remnant roots would inevitably allow it to blossom again. The Truku were only governmentally recognised as aboriginal peoples two decades after the park’s recognition, asserting the bureaucratic and colonial conception of the land being for the occupiers; a therapeutic and entertaining place, devoid of the people who called it home for generations. The poem, too, embodies this in its lack of human presence. Truly what is more absent of humanity than a poem performed by a web-browser reading code and running mathematics?

‘Taroko Gorge’ only shows 26 lines at a time, removing them from the page as they flow past the top. Nature and experience are deeply transient things, and one is only able to capture pale imitations of the past through art, photography, or screenshots. Our walk through the gorge cannot be recalled indefinitely, and we cannot walk the same path for an identical experience. Nature shifts in moments and in seasons: every 1.2 seconds, a new line will appear and an old one will fade. Nothing last forever; the passage of time is inevitable.

The message is similar from an indigenous perspective: the Truku’s past is, every 1200 milliseconds, being stolen from them and, try as they might, they can never fully recapture their relationship with the land. The inevitable ticking of the clock pushes it further and further from their grasp, both marked with unhealing scars. Instead, they and we must make a home in the present; read the new lines and follow the flow into something better.

In an era of digital media, the poem is a manifest realisation of the tourism now possible without leaving our keyboards. We can wander the pathways and forests of Taroko Gorge and take nothing from the land itself; leave it entirely undisturbed by our presence. The tourism industry overruns indigenous heritage spots and rots away culture into quirky and Instagrammable moments of ‘antiquated tribesmen’; ‘Taroko Gorge’ gives us experience without this damage. And yet it’s hollow, 2 dimensional, a poor imitation of reality and one that can only leave the heart longing for material experience. The digital is flawed and monotone; the material is divine. Would photographs sate our lust for imposing ourselves on the natural? Or are we doomed to become the gorge’s latest occupying force, operating under the imperial banner of the Tourist’s Republic? The poem at once shows a new, harmless form of travel while demonstrating in stark contrast of its limitations against reality.

Montfort’s ‘Taroko Gorge’ is ultimately a melancholic reflection on the majesty of nature and of a land robbed of humanity. Watching its stanzas tick on is a meditation in the transience of experience and of our presence on this earth.
